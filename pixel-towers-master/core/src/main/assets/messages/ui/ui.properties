ui.towerlist.towerinfo.crossbow_name=Crossbow tower
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.crossbow_desc=Crossbow towers are the most basic form of stationary weaponry, with a slight addition of magic those are able to target foes and shoot automatically. Great range allows those towers to handle threats that most are unable to reach, or eliminate foes before they even attack.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nThose towers were the first towers ever, created far before the Massive infestation. The prototype of those was a giant clunky mechanical crossbow, that used a couple of rats in a sensory box as a targeting mechanism, but that was really impractical to maintain. Soon after the dwarves researched ways of creating artificial life, the current version of the crossbow appeared, working on the same type of magic elementals are created from.\n\n_Branching_\nThe crossbow can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Ballista or The Gatling.\n\n%23$s\n\n%24$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.magicmissile_name=Magic Missile tower
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.magicmissile_desc=Magic missile wands are the simplest form of all wand towers. Those deal damage that bypasses any armor and can be effective against the toughest foes\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nStationary wands aren't actually towers of any kind, those are just normal wands put into a stand and infused with an enhanced alarm spell. Rumors say, that first stationary wands were invented accidentally: a lost wand got possessed by a ghost and started casting bolts at anyone nearby, and some wizard simply replicated it's behaviour.  \n\n_Branching_\nThe magic missile tower has no upgrade branches.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.wall_name=A Wall
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.wall_desc=Functions of a wall are obvious: hold the enemy for time long enough for your towers to kill it. Walls, unlike all others towers, are not that fragile and can take a lot of hits before being destroyed\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nArmor: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%10$d_ -> _%11$d_ -> _%12$d_\n\n%13$s\n\n_History_\nNo scholar, knight or priest can say when did walls appear with confidence. But for all the time they existed they were incredibly useful, with their insane ability to defend borders.\n\n_Branching_\nAfter lvl 3 walls can be upgraded further, into two different branches: a _Spiked Metal Barricade_ and a _Runic Monolith_.\n\n%14$s\n\n%15$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.cannon_name=Cannon
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.cannon_desc=Cannons are towers that are able to strike multiple enemies at once, handling hordes of weaker mobs with ease. Cannons might seem like an obvious choice: the possible max damage of those may reach insane levels, with almost every wave being a horde; the problem with those is them being much more expensive and being able to push enemies randomly \n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_ (+ x0.5 damage in an area)\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nFirst cannons ever were created somewhere near 12-th century in China, ruled by Song dynasty. Their main flaw was the necessity of a living being controlling them, which dwarven engineers and warlocks easily overcame, infusing their cannons with targeting and elemental magic. The latter was necessity for the cannon to have infinite ammo: the bombs this cannon shoots are not actually bombs, but reformed fireballs.\n\n_Branching_\nThe cannon can be upgraded to two branches: the Arcane Nuke and the missile launcher\n\n%23$s\n\n%24$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.grave_name=Gravestone
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.grave_desc=Gravestones, aka gravestone towers, are the most common spawning structure necromancers use. Those are very helpful, when you need a helping hand at holding back foes, especially when normal walls are all destroyed. Skeletons will stay where they were summoned, protecting their gravestone and towers close to it.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nMax minions limit: _%4$d_ -> _%5$d_ -> _%6$d_\nCooldown between summons: _%7$d_ -> _%8$d_ -> _%9$d_\nMinion HP: _%10$d_ -> _%11$d_ -> _%12$d_\nMinion damage: _%13$d_-_%14$d_ -> _%15$d_-_%16$d_ -> _%17$d_-_%18$d_\nMinion accuracy: _%19$d_%% -> _%20$d_%% -> _%21$d_%%\nMinion evasion: _%22$d_%% -> _%23$d_%% -> _%24$d_%%\nMinion defense: _0-%25$d_ -> _0-%26$d_ -> _0-%27$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%28$d_ -> _%29$d_ -> _%30$d_\n%31$s\n\n_History_\nDark arts always were a taboo for heroes, especially necromancy, but in the times when the whole world is in danger every measure must be taken to save it. Gravestones are the result of the Holy order, the Paranormal Activity Regulation Council, King's Science Court and the Magistrate of Dark arts uniting their efforts. They created a spell to catch random souls and revive them into subservient undead creatures, and gravestones are continuously being supplied by mana around and cast that exact spell, creating skeletons.\n\n_Branching_\nThe gravestone can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Vile Grave or The Crypt.\n\n%32$s\n\n%33$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.guard_name=Guard
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.guard_desc=Sometimes power of a living being surpasses any technology, and then we speak about guards - hirable companions, who will protect their spot till the end. They will stand in one place and attack foes only if they come really close. Also guards can rest during wave cooldowns, regenerating _at least a third_ of their max HP (if the cooldown is longer, they usually regenerate to full HP).\n\nUnlike other usual towers or minions, guards are sentient and can be directed to change their position, which is very useful when foes are coming from sudden directions or when the guard needs to retreat to heal.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nEnemy detection range: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\nArmor: _%19$d - %20$d_ -> _%21$d - %22$d_ -> _%23$d - %24$d_\nRegeneration during cooldowns: _%25$d_ -> _%26$d_ -> _%27$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%28$d_ -> _%29$d_ -> _%30$d_\n\n%31$s\n\n_History_\nNo one knows what these guards are, how are they able to fit into a single bubble or why the shopkeeper is able to sell them in infinite numbers. Due to this lack of even basic information, the history of those guards is unknown, yet there are rumors that those were used in Kingdom's prisons for at least a couple hundred years.\n\n_Branching_\nThe guard can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Knight or The Spearman\n\n%32$s\n\n%33$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.lightning_name=Lightning rod
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.lightning_desc=Magical lightning rods are modified lightning wands, which can accumulate their charge infinitely. When an enemy comes close to them, the rods emit a powerful lightning bolt into the foe. The bolt may affect several enemies if they are next to each other, and the damage will be spread amongst them.\n\nAlso, there is a tricky thing to this lightning: because of it being magical, it won't hurt your towers if they are in a lightning chain, yet they can all still conduct it. That means that the bolt does not lose any energy, while passing through friendly units, and the chain may affect enemies far away, if the lightning bolt finds a "safe path" to them.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\nMax enemies in a chain: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%22$d_ -> _%23$d_ -> _%24$d_\n\n%25$s\n\n_History_\nFirst lightning rods worked without any magic: some guy just rotated a wheel, which electrified a metal rod. Anybody who came near those would be heavily shocked. Adding magic to such a contraption kills two birds with one stone: there is no necessity in physical charging anymore, and the rod will strike only enemy units, not just all who walk near it.\n\n_Branching_\nThe lightning rod has no branching.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.totem_name=Totems
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.totem_desc=Long before normal weaponry appeared, people relied on prayers and simple magic, such as totems. There is a lot of totems, each of them has a unique sigil, which determines what the totem does: buff friends or curse foes, summon undead or kill the living, bring danger or ward from it instead...\n\n_History_\nTotems have existed since the beginning of sentience as we know it: gnolls and goblins, humans and dwarves prayed to both imaginary and real gods, using totems as a connection focus.\n\n_Variation_\nThere is a ton of totems in the dungeon, most common of those are listed here:\n\n_%1$s_\n%2$s\n\n_%3$s_\n%4$s\n\n_%5$s_\n%6$s\n\n_%7$s_\n%8$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.dartgun_name=Dart gun
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.dartgun_desc=Dart guns are quite unique among all towers: they have insane attack range and deal two types of damage: physical, and poison. This allows the dart guns to penetrate most of enemy defenses, and be moderately effective against the widest variety of foes. But that comes at a cost: the tower itself can only shoot horizontally or vertically, and both darts and poison are, obviously, useless against armored bots.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\nPoison damage (over time): _3_ -> _7_ -> _12_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\nDart guns and their branches can only shoot in horizontal or vertical directions, prioritize not poisoned foes.\n\n_History_\nDart guns are an old mechanism used in temple dart traps to protect treasures and relics. As no blueprints existed each temple had them made from scratch, and the final schematic for the dart tower was... just a copy of a random dart gun.\n\nDespite those dart guns having very old designs, those were introduced to weapon arsenals quite recently, and that old design was modified a bit, increasing its detection range while removing necessity of pressure plates to activate, yet lowering the possible facing directions to four.\n\n_Branching_\nThe dartgun can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Venom Spitter or The Dart Sniper Rifle.\n\n%22$s\n\n%23$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.tntlog_name=A rogue-dressed log with TNT on it.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.tntlog_desc=An unique invention, though simple, yet effective. A log distracts enemies, while they hit it, and in the end, when the log is destroyed, it explodes, dealing massive damage to all creatures dumb enough to attack it.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ \nDeath explosion damage: _%2$d - %3$d_ \n\nTotal cost: _%4$d_\n\nOn death explodes, dealing damage to every enemy unit nearby (in a 3x3 area)\n\n_History_\nThe history of non-living things dressed as humans precedes any magic or monster infested dungeons. In early days, humanity used those as scarecrows to, well, scare birds away. Some made realistic wooden human models to attract monsters or animals, trapping them by setting up a pit near it, or just attacking them when they are nearby. Goblins used hero-dressed sticks to scare away less intelligent goblins, guards sometimes placed guard-dressed mannequins on their spot to ditch work... I could write for hours, yet this is too long to describe.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.miner_name=Automatic drill
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.miner_desc=Drills are used for mining, and this dungeon is no exception! This drill will keep mining gold until it is destroyed, dropping it around after each wave finishes.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _200_ \nGold per wave: _varies_\n\n_History_\nMachines are much more useful than humans: they don't require food, entertainment or comfort. Dwarves understood that well, and instead of venturing into caves to mine gold every time just put drills in there, so the gold is automatically mined while they are absent. There was yet a problem: goblins, a ton of them. Goblins took all the gold from those drills, rendering them useless, and forcing the dwarves to abandon the mines with all the drills built. Why didn't they slay the nasty green creatures? Why did they leave the incredibly useful drills? I guess their civilization was weakening at this time...
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.pylon_name=Electric pylon
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.pylon_desc=Pylons are capable of charging electricity from geothermal energy, blasting lightning bolts at foes nearby.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _300_ \nDamage: _10-20_\nRange: _8_\n\n_History_\nInitially, tesla pylons were used to charge DM-300's to create mine shafts, yet the demon invasion required all the power necessary. So, almost all pylons were rebuilt into towers, and now can "charge" foes instead, with much higher voltage.\n\nNotice that most of the pylons dwarves left are broken, yet can still be fixed.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.disintegration_name=#Rod of Disintegration#
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.disintegration_desc=Disintegration rods are capable of shooting powerful rays, which never miss, deal constant damage, pierce though enemies, but can hit allies. The other disintegration wands are not affected by it's rays.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\n Those rods have power from beyond our dimension, and all who know what they are, are afraid to even look at them. When a star dies, a rift forms, and any substance, usually it is a mix of plasma and magma, is infused with chaos energy from that rift. When the material cools down and chaos-infused magma forms obsidian crystals, those are created. Rumors say, breaking these causes a rift in reality.
