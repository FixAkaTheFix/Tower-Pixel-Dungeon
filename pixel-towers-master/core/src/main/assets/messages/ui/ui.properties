ui.towerlist.towerinfo.crossbow_name=Crossbow tower
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.crossbow_desc=Crossbow towers are the most basic form of stationary weaponry, with a slight addition of magic those are able to target foes and shoot automatically. Great range allows these towers to handle threats that most are unable to reach, or eliminate foes before they get to attack.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nThese towers were the first towers ever, created long before the Massive Infestation. The prototype of these was a giant clunky mechanical crossbow that used a couple of rats in a sensory box as a targeting mechanism, but that was really impractical to maintain. Soon after the dwarves researched ways of creating artificial life, the current version of the crossbow appeared, working through the same type of magic elementals are created from.\n\n_Branching_\nThe crossbow can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Ballista or The Gatling.\n\n%23$s\n\n%24$s\n\n_Arrow volley_\nArrow volley ability allows to direct the fire onto one point, dealing damage of all of your crossbows' arrows to one single target.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.magicmissile_name=Magic Missile tower
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.magicmissile_desc=Magic missile wands are the simplest form of all wand towers. These deal damage that bypasses any armor and can be effective against the toughest foes.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: #5%4$d#5 - #5%5$d#5 -> #5%6$d#5 - #5%7$d#5 -> #5%8$d#5 - #5%9$d#5\nAccuracy: _Never misses_\nAttack speed: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_ \nRange: _%13$d_ -> _%14$d_ -> _%15$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\n%19$s\n\n_History_\nStationary wands aren't actually towers of any kind, they are just regular wands put on a stand and infused with an enhanced alarm spell. Rumors say, that first stationary wands were invented by accident: a lost wand got possessed by a ghost and started casting bolts at anyone nearby, and some wizard simply replicated its behaviour.\n\n_Branching_\nThe magic missile tower has no upgrade branches.\n\n_Overcharge_\nOvercharge ability infuses your wands with mana, allowing them to fire at incredible speeds fr a short time. Good for clearing tougher waves.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.wall_name=A Wall
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.wall_desc=The function of a wall is obvious: hold the enemy back for a long enough time to let your towers deal with it. Walls, unlike all other towers, are not fragile and can take a lot of beating before getting destroyed.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nArmor: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%10$d_ -> _%11$d_ -> _%12$d_\n\n%13$s\n\n_History_\nNo scholar, knight or priest can tell when walls first appeared with confidence. But throughout their entire existence they're incredibly useful, with their great ability to maintain borders.\n\n_Branching_\nAfter lvl 3 walls can be upgraded further into two different branches: a _Spiked Metal Barricade_ or a _Runic Monolith_.\n\n%14$s\n\n%15$s\n\n_Great wall_\nThis ability connects nearby defensive structures with mana, giving each wall instance a barrier, the power of which is based on hp of other walls nearby.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.cannon_name=Cannon
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.cannon_desc=Cannons are towers that are able to strike multiple enemies at once, handling hordes of weaker mobs with ease. Cannons might seem like an universal choice: their effective damage can reach incredible levels with almost every wave being a horde; the problems with them are their higher construction price and a tendency to push enemies unpredictably.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d_ - _%5$d_ -> _%6$d_ - _%7$d_ -> _%8$d_ - _%9$d_ #2(+ x0.5 damage in a 3x3 area)#2\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nFirst cannons ever were created sometime around 12-th century in China, ruled by Song dynasty. Their main flaw was the necessity of a living being controlling them, which dwarven engineers and warlocks easily overcame by infusing their cannons with targeting and elemental magic. The latter was necessary for the cannon to not require ammo: the bombs these shoot are not actually bombs, but specialized fireballs.\n\n_Branching_\nA cannon can be further upgraded to two branches: the Arcane Nuke and the Missile Launcher.\n\n%23$s\n\n%24$s\n\n_Bomb volley_\nWhen a horde approaches, you can target your cannons' shots into it, creating a field of explosions from cannon shots.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.grave_name=Gravestone
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.grave_desc=Gravestones, aka gravestone towers, are the most common spawning structure necromancers use. These are great for when you need a helping hand, with or without a body, to hold back foes, especially once conventional walls are all destroyed. Skeletons will stay where they were summoned, protecting the gravestone and nearby towers.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nMax minions limit: _%4$d_ -> _%5$d_ -> _%6$d_\nCooldown between summons: _%7$d_ -> _%8$d_ -> _%9$d_\nMinion HP: _%10$d_ -> _%11$d_ -> _%12$d_\nMinion damage: _%13$d_-_%14$d_ -> _%15$d_-_%16$d_ -> _%17$d_-_%18$d_\nMinion accuracy: _%19$d_%% -> _%20$d_%% -> _%21$d_%%\nMinion evasion: _%22$d_%% -> _%23$d_%% -> _%24$d_%%\nMinion defense: _0-%25$d_ -> _0-%26$d_ -> _0-%27$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%28$d_ -> _%29$d_ -> _%30$d_\n%31$s\n\n_History_\nDark arts were always a taboo for heroes, especially necromancy, but in times when the whole world is in danger, every measure must be taken to save it. Gravestones are the result of the Holy order, the Paranormal Activity Regulation Council, Royal Science Court and the Magistrate of Dark Arts uniting their efforts. They created a spell to catch passing souls and revive them into subservient undead creatures, and gravestones continuously cast that exact spell, creating skeletons.\n\n_Branching_\nThe gravestone can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Vile Grave or The Crypt.\n\n%32$s\n\n%33$s\n\n_Anger the dead_\nThis ability raises souls without forming a body, resulting in creating explosive skulls from each gravestone.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.guard_name=Guard
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.guard_desc=Sometimes the power of a living being surpasses any technology, and that's the case with guards - hirable companions who will protect their spot til the end. They will stand still and attack approaching foes. Guards get to rest during wave cooldowns, regenerating some of their HP (if the cooldown is longer, they may regenerate to full HP).\n\nUnlike the usual towers or minions, guards are sentient and can be instructed to relocate, which is very useful when foes suddenly switch directions or when the guard needs to retreat to heal.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nEnemy detection range: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\nArmor: _%19$d - %20$d_ -> _%21$d - %22$d_ -> _%23$d - %24$d_\nRegeneration during cooldowns (per turn): _%25$d_ -> _%26$d_ -> _%27$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%28$d_ -> _%29$d_ -> _%30$d_\n\n%31$s\n\n_History_\nNo one knows what these guards are, how are they able to fit into a single bubble or why the shopkeeper is able to sell them in infinite numbers. Due to this lack of even basic information, the history of guards is unknown, yet there are rumors that they were used in the Kingdom's prisons for at least a couple hundred years.\n\n_Branching_\nThe guard can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Paladin or The Spearman.\n\n%32$s\n\n%33$s\n\n_Order_\nThis ability allows for better control of your army, directing all guards onto one point.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.lightning_name=Lightning rod
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.lightning_desc=Magical lightning rods are modified lightning wands which can accumulate charge infinitely. When an enemy comes close enough, the rods release a powerful lightning bolt. The bolt may affect several enemies if they stand close to each other, and the damage will spread amongst them.\n\nAlso, there is a trick to this lightning: because it's magical, your own towers will not be harmed by the electricity despite conducting it. This means that the bolt does not lose any energy passing through friendly units, and the chain may affect enemies far away if the lightning bolt finds a "safe path" to them.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: #5%4$d#5 - #5%5$d#5 -> #5%6$d#5 - #5%7$d#5 -> #5%8$d#5 - #5%9$d#5\nAccuracy: _Never misses_\nAttack speed: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_ \nRange: _%13$d_ -> _%14$d_ -> _%15$d_\nMax enemies in a chain: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\n%22$s\n\n_History_\nThe first lightning rods functioned without any magic: a worker turned a generator wheel, which electrified a remote metal rod. Anybody near the rod would get zapped. Adding magic to such a contraption kills two birds with one stone: there is no need for physical charging anymore, and the rod will not strike indiscriminately.\n\n_Branching_\nThe lightning rod has no branching.\n\n_Lightning strike_\nLightning strike ability creates a bolt at a location, striking a single foe. This bolt can be cast faster with the amount and power of lightning towers increasing, while also bypassing any armor the foe has.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.totem_name=Totems
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.totem_desc=Long before conventional weaponry people relied on prayers and simple magic, such as totems. There are many kinds of totems, each bearing a unique sigil which determines the totem's function: bless allies or curse foes, summon undead or kill the living, manifest danger or ward from it instead...\n\n_History_\nTotems have existed since the beginning of sentience as we know it: gnolls and goblins, humans and dwarves prayed to both imaginary and real gods, using totems as a connection focus.\n\n_Variation_\nThere is a ton of totems in the dungeon, most common of those are listed here:\n\n_%1$s_\n%2$s\n\n_%3$s_\n%4$s\n\n_%5$s_\n%6$s\n\n_%7$s_\n%8$s
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.dartgun_name=Dart gun
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.dartgun_desc=Dart guns are quite unique among all towers: they have a uniquely high attack range and deal two types of damage: physical and poison. This allows the dart guns to penetrate most enemy defenses, and stay effective against a wide variety of foes. But that comes at a cost: the tower itself can only shoot horizontally or vertically, and both darts and poison are useless against armored bots.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: _%4$d - %5$d_ -> _%6$d - %7$d_ -> _%8$d - %9$d_\nAccuracy: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_\nAttack speed: _%13$d%%_ -> _%14$d%%_ -> _%15$d%%_ \nRange: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\nPoison damage (over time): #43#4 -> #47#4 -> #412#4\n\nTotal cost: _%19$d_ -> _%20$d_ -> _%21$d_\n\nDart guns and their branches can only shoot in cardinal directions and prioritize non-poisoned foes.\n\n_History_\nDart guns are an ancient mechanism used in temple dart traps to protect treasures and relics. As blueprints weren't a thing yet, every temple had them developed from scratch, and the final schematic for the dart tower was... just a copy of a random dart gun.\n\nDespite being an old design, these were only introduced to weapon arsenals and modernized quite recently, increasing their detection range and replacing pressure plates in favor of automatic targeting, but restricting the aiming angles to four.\n\n_Branching_\nThe dart gun can be upgraded to two branches upon reaching level 3: The Venom Spitter or The Dart Sniper Rifle.\n\n%22$s\n\n%23$s\n\n_Dart golem?_\nThe ability creates a living dartgun, which will aid you in killing the foe. It can be upgraded, yet its HP is abysmally low, so you need to better position your hero for it be effective and intact.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.tntlog_name=A rogue-dressed log with TNT on it
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.tntlog_desc=An unique invention, simple, yet effective. The log distracts enemies and once it's destroyed, it explodes, dealing massive damage to gullible attackers.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ \nDeath explosion damage: #2%2$d#2 - #2%3$d#2 \n\nTotal cost: _%4$d_\n\nExplodes on death, dealing damage to every enemy unit nearby (in a 5x5 area).\n\n_History_\nThe practice of dressing non-living things in human clothing precedes any magic or monster infested dungeons. In the olden days, humanity used similar constructs as scarecrows to, well, scare crows away. Realistic human models were made to bait monsters or animals, trapping them in disguised pits, or just attacking them when they approach. Goblins used hero-dressed sticks to scare away less intelligent goblins, guards sometimes placed guard-dressed mannequins on their spot to ditch work... I could list examples for hours and never run out.\n\n_Plan B_\nWhen foes come close, you have no choice... this ability explodes all of your roguelogs at once, with the benefit of dealing double damage to foes near the blast.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.miner_name=Automatic drill
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.miner_desc=Drills are used for mining anywhere they are placed, and this dungeon is no exception! This drill will mine gold until it is destroyed, dropping the goods nearby at the end of each wave.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _200_ \nGold per wave: _varies_\n\n_History_\nMachines are much more efficient than humans: they don't require food, entertainment or comfort. Dwarves understood that well, and instead of venturing into caves to mine gold every time, simply installed automatic drills in there, so the gold keeps piling up in their absence. There was one problem: goblins, a ton of them. Goblins looted all the produced gold, rendering the drills useless, forcing the dwarves to abandon the mines with all the drills built. Why didn't they slay the nasty green creatures? Why did they leave behind their advanced contraptions? I guess their collapsing civilization had bigger concerns at the time...
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.pylon_name=Electric pylon
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.pylon_desc=Pylons are capable of converting geothermal energy to electricity, blasting lightning bolts at nearby foes.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _300_ \nDamage: _10-20_\nRange: _8_\n\n_History_\nInitially, Tesla pylons (named after their dwarven engineer inventor Nickela Tesla) were used to charge DM-300s for drilling mineshafts, but were repurposed to assist in holding back the demon invasion. Most pylons were reconfigured into towers, and now can "charge" foes instead, with much higher voltage.\n\nNotice that most of the pylons dwarves left behind are broken, yet can still be fixed.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.disintegration_name=Rod of Disintegration
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.disintegration_desc=Disintegration rods are capable of casting destructive rays, which never miss, deal huge and persistent damage and pierce entities. The drawback is they can damage you and your non-tower allies too.\n\n_Stats_\nMax tower HP: _%1$d_ -> _%2$d_ -> _%3$d_\nDamage: #5%4$d#5 - #5%5$d#5 -> #5%6$d#5 - #5%7$d#5 -> #5%8$d#5 - #5%9$d#5\nAccuracy: _Never misses_\nAttack speed: _%10$d%%_ -> _%11$d%%_ -> _%12$d%%_ \nRange: _%13$d_ -> _%14$d_ -> _%15$d_\n\nTotal cost: _%16$d_ -> _%17$d_ -> _%18$d_\n\n%19$s. The damage to allies is equal to a third of base damage.\n\n_History_\nThese rods draw power from beyond our dimension, and all those familiar with their nature are afraid to even look at them. When a star dies, a rift forms, and any nearby substance, usually a mix of plasma and magma, is infused with potent chaos energy from the rift. Once the material cools down and chaos-infused magma crystallizes into volcanic glass, these rods form. Rumor has it, breaking these can cause a rift in reality.\n\n_Nullify_\nThis ability makes rod rays start to syphon energy from enemies too, making them immune to effects, lowering physical defenses they have and sometimes stealing their special traits from them: goblins can't regenerate, monks - block, magicrabs lose their magic resistance etc... The amount of shots given by that spell to wands is constant, so you won't lose too much if the wave was too easy.
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.ratcamp_name=Rat camp
ui.towerlist.towerinfo.ratcamp_desc=Rat camp tents deploy rats when enemies come close enough to the tent, not more than once per wave. When enemies are defeated rats continue fighting, providing distraction maneuvers, exploring the map and let enemies get a taste of their own wave medicine.\n\n_Description_\nRats were never that good at battle, only a select few being able to learn dodging or basic magic. Rats generals needed a solution, and came up with magical training tents. These tents are much bigger than they seem to be, with a whole training ground inside. If provided with tools and weaponry, rats inside may train decent enough to be proper soldiers, moreover, such space management allows for training legions of rats on one dungeon floor.\n\n_Rats you can summon:_\n\n_%1$s - unlocked by default_\n%2$s\n\nHP: %3$d\nDamage: %4$d-%5$d\nDefense: %6$d-%7$d\nCost: %8$d\n\n_%9$s - unlocked on depths 3 and deeper_\n%10$s\n\nHP: %11$d\nDamage: %12$d-%13$d\nDefense: %14$d-%15$d\nCost: %16$d\n\n_%17$s - unlocked on depths 6 and deeper_\n%18$s\n\nHP: %19$d\nDamage: %20$d-%21$d\nRange: 2\nDefense: %22$d-%23$d\nCost: %24$d\n\n_%25$s - on depths 8 and deeper_\n%26$s\n\nHP: %27$d\nDamage: %28$d-%29$d x2\nRange: 7\nDefense: %30$d-%31$d\nCost: %32$d\n\n_%33$s - unlocked on depths 11 and deeper_\n%34$s\n\nHP: %35$d\nMagical damage: %36$d-%37$d\nRange: 6\nDefense: %38$d-%39$d\nCost: %40$d\n\n_Hyperrats_\nThis ability upgrades all of next wave's ratforcements, giving them specific champion titles.
