items.artifacts.masterthievesarmband.desc_worn=You feel power building in the armband on your wrist as you gain experience. You can use this power to steal from shops, or to rob enemies!\n\nRobbing enemies happens instantly and gives you a chance to get whatever loot they have! This power is more effective against unaware enemies.\n\nAttempting to steal from shops can be done as many times you wish to, however shopkeepers may not like it, and _may throw anything they have at hand at you_ if they notice it.

items.artifacts.sandalsofnature.desc_2=The footwear has grown and now more closely resemble two tailored shoes. Some colour has returned to them, perhaps they can still grow further?\n\nCurrently, walking creates grass with a 10% chance.

items.artifacts.sandalsofnature.desc_cursed=The cursed sandals are blocking any attunement with nature and wither each plant they touch.

The parchment is slowly building charge as time passes and when you discover hidden doors or traps.\n\nThe parchment can expend its charge to 'scry' in a cone shape, which will grant you vision of enemies and items in the revealed area.

items.artifacts.talismanofforesight$observer.desc=Observers are minor ethereal elementals which are used by magicians to spy on their foes or keep an eye on their belongings while they are gone. Though they are very effective in what they do, they are both not intelligent nor invisible and may appear very annoying to creatures they gaze at. An observer looking at an enemy distracts them from their usual task and pretty much _forces them to attack the observer_, which will try to fly away.
items.artifacts.talismanofforesight$observer.descstats=Observers can dodge attacks easily, due to their form being unstable, but are not that fast and die upon receiving any damage.


items.artifacts.brokenhourglass.name=Broken hourglass

This can be deactivated at any time by using the hourglass or attacking.
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass.desc=This large ornate hourglass looks fairly unassuming, but you feel a great power in its finely carved frame. As you rotate the hourglass and watch the sand pour you can feel its magic tugging at you, surely using this magic would give you some control over time. 
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass.canupgrade=You can give some of your time to the hourglass, partially refilling it with sand. Time is an intricate matter: while giving a bit of it to the cause may be very productive, the more dedicated you are, the more time you will have to spend.
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass.cannotupgrade=The hourglass is filled with sands of time, is at its max power, and does not require any energy from you anymore.

items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass.no_time=You don't have the time to do this yet...
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass.desc_cursed=The cursed hourglass is locked to your side, you can feel it trying to manipulate your flow of time.
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass$timefreeze.name=Time Freeze
items.artifacts.timekeepershourglass$timefreeze.desc=Time is frozen around you, allowing you to perform actions instantly. The effect will last until it is cancelled or your hourglass runs out of charge. Attacking or using magic will break this effect as well.

Its pages seem to turn by themselves, and on every single one of them, are written incantations you cannot decipher. If you read from this book, there's no telling what spell you might cast.
items.artifacts.unstablespellbook.desc_cursed=The cursed tome has bound itself to you, it is inhibiting your ability to use most scrolls.
