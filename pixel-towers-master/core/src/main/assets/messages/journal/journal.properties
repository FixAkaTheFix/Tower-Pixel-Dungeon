journal.document.adventurers_guide.title=All necessary things to know
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Towers, the book of Great Knowledge, the source of all tower Secrets! This book will tell you all the necessary information about this dungeon.\n\nEven if you like to learn stuff by yourself, this book may be very useful, as it can tell you some interesting facts, like these ones:\n- Crossbows can auto-aim because of eldritch spells\n- The portal is trapped with exactly 9 traps on the other side\n- Your hero is an immortal demigod\n\nHope you are intrigued enough! May this book be of use to you!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.portal.title=The Portal
journal.document.adventurers_guide.portal.body=That blue portal is a rift to your hometown, and the tool for you to travel between floors. Monsters, being generic evil beings of a dungeon, will attempt to reach it, but this time, with a more... interesting plan. If they seal the portal from the other side, no hero will come into the dungeon again and the expansion of the Darkness won't ever be stopped.\n\nLucky for you, your hero is not a fool. The portal is trapped from the other side, and can handle a few enemies coming in. To be exact: the portal has 10 defense points, and the enemies deal it different damage:\n- Normal enemies damage it by _1_ point\n- Stronger enemies and minibosses damage it by _3_ points\n- As no trap can handle a boss, each boss deals _10_ points\nAnd yeah, there is no way to replenish those defense points. Unless you want to go back to the portal to prepare all the traps again, but this will erase all progress.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.hero.title=The Hero
journal.document.adventurers_guide.hero.body=The first creature you might see moving is You: the hero that entered the dungeon. It is your avatar: through it, you interact with the world, fight monsters and seal Eldritch Gods. The hero has a weapon, an armor piece, three slots for artifacts and rings, and a whole backpack to collect more items.\n\nBeing an avatar, your hero cannot truly die: once enough damage is dealt to him, he faints only to reappear near the portal after some turns. However when the portal is closed, the hero cannot turn back and the run is finished; so sometimes risking your hero's life may be very effective measure to take.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.mobs.title=The Monster hordes
journal.document.adventurers_guide.mobs.body=Each dungeon is filled with monsters, and this one is no exception! Tons of beasts, magical beings and demons will attempt to slay your hero and destroy the portal.\n\nDealing with enemies may be tricky: Shamans attack from a distance, Crabs have armored shells and some enemies, like snakes, rush to the amulet without any concerns for you and those defenses of yours, but each time there is a solution at hand. Area attacks, bombs and potions easily deal with hordes, towers with good range can reach ranged enemies, and using your hero, obstacles like magical sheep or slowing magic you can stall any foe enough for your towers to defeat it.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.towers.title=The Towers
journal.document.adventurers_guide.towers.body=When armies confront you, you need your own army as well! Towers are very useful when it comes to defending, as they are able to take enemies down before they come close enough. To set up a tower, you need to buy a kit from a shopkeeper and throw it to a cell where you want the tower to be deployed. Also to note: walls are "towers" which cannot attack, but have increased HP and defense and are used to protect other towers because of it.\n\nOn levels 3 and above towers can be upgraded. Upgrades boost the towers stats without any disadvantages. There are 4 tiers of upgrades; second is available from lvl 3, third - from levels 8 (for crossbows and cannons) and 10 (for other). The final, fourth upgrade branches give you bonuses on the branch you choose and is available from (approximately) lvl 11 and on.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.spells.title=Spellcasting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.spells.body=Each hero knows several unique spells, which can help in different situations. Each spell has a cooldown, which prevents you from using any spell for some time: the stronger is the spell, the longer is the cooldown. This cooldown prevents usage of any spell, even not the one you have used.\n\nSpells are free, so using them consistently may increase your fighting prowess. These are distinguishing abilities of classes, so try experimenting with them, maybe a duelist enjoyer may find necromancer or huntress much more powerful.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Hunger is no problem in a dungeon where each floor takes 10 minutes to clear, but here the food is... Magical! Each food piece can heal your wounds, that is if you have enough time for a meal.\n\nEach food item needs a set amount of turns to be eaten. Food healing will apply only when you are eating, and will stop if your meal is interrupted by anything. All the healing of the portion of food which is already eaten will remain.\n\nRemember: food is very cheap and easy way to replenish health, so do not hesitate to buy a pie or two in the shop when those are in stock!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.damage.title=Damage types
journal.document.adventurers_guide.damage.body=Apart from normal, physical damage there is also magical and elemental damage types. They all have some differences a dungeoneer needs to acknowledge:\n\n_Physical_ damage is the most common type, dealt by most hits, explosions, force waves, collisions etc. Each enemy has some sort of protection utilized, so weak physical attacks may not be effective against armored foes at all\n\n_Magical_ attacks are able to pierce enemy's defenses and almost can't be avoided. Why don't use mage always? Magic is generally weaker and is usually limited to charges or mana. \n\n_Elemental_ damage is dealt by lightning bolts, fire and other energy sources, toxic and corrosive fumes. This type cannot be evaded, unless you have specific immunity to it.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title=Scavenging for resources
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body=The dungeon is insanely large, and the supply of resources and goods it can provide is almost infinite. Levels are filled with precious loot, which can greatly increase your survival odds. You just need to go a bit away from your base... no risk, no reward.\n\nThe best ways to do so is during longer cooldowns - time periods between waves. During that time you are completely safe to walk around or leave.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.shopkeeper.title=Shopkeeper
journal.document.adventurers_guide.shopkeeper.body=In other dungeons shopkeepers mostly sell utter crap for through-the-roof prices, but this time the shop will be the most important place for you to visit. New shopkeepers are able to sell such rarities as strength and healing potions, rings and artifacts, even scrolls of upgrade! And all these cost much less than an arm and a leg you had to sell before!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title=2 Paths
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body=There are two ways you can become stronger. The first one is reinforcing your defenses and upgrading towers to make your base protected enough. The second one is upgrading the hero, making it easier to collect resources around and fighting enemies by yourself. But almost always the right path is the middle one. Balancing between base and hero upgrades, acknowledging your weak sides and adapting to the current situation may be hard, but it is the only way to succeed.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.time.title=Time-management
journal.document.adventurers_guide.time.body=After each wave there is a cooldown, when no enemies are threatening to destroy the Amulet and the hero is safe. Each time you have to choose where to go: you can try to find resources, you can set up your defenses, shop for food or read a book. Each your action matters, as travelling too far may expose your base or a sale on a strength pot can be missed. Always staying near your base is not an option too, as you will miss on the resources scattered around the level.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Your experience level boosts your health, and awards talent points, and that can make a big difference in combat.\n\nAs this time hordes of mobs are attacking you, levelling up is as easy as pie, but it does not boost your accuracy, stealth or evasion in any way, only giving talent points for you to choose your own gameplay style.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title=Positioning
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body=Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning. If your towers have also been set up in a right way, a way which does not let any threat from ANY direction pass safely, you may become undefeatable.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.bosses.title=Bosses and minibosses
journal.document.adventurers_guide.bosses.body=Sometimes foes even more powerful can come to attack you. Those are called "Bosses" and are usually stronger than other monsters, having special attacks, incredible stats or interesting properties. Minibosses usually come at every fifth wave, with bosses appearing on the last wave. Only after the boss is slain and it's minions have fallen, you may proceed further into the dungeon.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=Strength is a mechanic which determines your melee effectiveness. Higher values of strength allow for equipping better weapons and armor, and the better those are, the greater power your hero has. For example, tier 2 and 3 weapons may inflict debuffs on hit, and heavier armor has better defense.


journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Intro and Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nAlchemy recipes can be used to craft a wide variety of items at an alchemy pot. You can experiment to find recipes, or continue reading this book for a full recipe reference!\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a random potion!\n\nEvery seed has a potion counterpart, and the potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used. Using multiple of the same seed will increase the chance for this to occur.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two rocks within the pot. This creates runestones!
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title=Energy and Food
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body=Many recipes require crystalized alchemical energy, which is produced by deconstructing most consumable items in an alchemy pot. As a few examples: seeds generate 2 energy, stones generate 3, scrolls and potions each generate 6.\n\nSome of these recipes are quite magical, but these ones more resemble traditional cooking.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title=Exotic Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body=Potions can be mixed with energy to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title=Exotic Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body=Exotic scrolls can be made with some energy and a scroll. They're a bit stronger and more expensive than exotic potions.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title=Enhanced Bombs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body=A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.title=Enhancing Weapons
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.body=Some of the lighter or more magical weapons can be used in alchemy!\n\nEach thrown weapon produces enough liquid metal to fully repair another weapon of the same level and tier.\n\nOne wand will produce enough arcane resin to upgrade two wands of the same level, but no higher than +3.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.title=Catalysts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.body=Catalysts are made by combining a scroll or potion with a single seed or runestone. If the pair of items match, the alchemical energy cost is removed.\n\nCatalysts are most useful as components in recipes covered in the next two pages, but also can be used in a pinch for a random effect.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title=Brews and Elixirs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body=Brews and elixirs are advanced potions which provide a variety of effects with a single use.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title=Spells
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body=Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects with multiple uses.

journal.document.intros.title=Region Introductions
journal.document.intros.dungeon.title=Dungeon
journal.document.intros.dungeon.body=Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above, all of them have never been heard from again, except YOU\n\nIt is said that an ancient evil guards the almighty Amulet of Yendor... But you have the Amulet on yourself, and now you realize taking it was a fatal mistake. The darkness became much stronger, thousands of monsters infest the dungeon halls.\n\nWill you conquer the dungeon and seal Yog-Dzewa back? It's time to start your own adventure...again.
journal.document.intros.sewers.title=Sewers
journal.document.intros.sewers.body=The upper floors of the dungeon actually constitute the city's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more ferocious. The Rat king, willing to defend all of the uncorrupted rodents of his kingdom, has locked the upper floors.\n\nThe evil magic at work here is weak, but you should never let your guard down.
journal.document.intros.prison.title=Prison
journal.document.intros.prison.body=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
journal.document.intros.caves.title=Caves
journal.document.intros.caves.body=These sparsely populated caves stretch down under the abandoned prison. Rich in minerals, they were once a center of bustling trade and industry for the dwarven society below, but they were abandoned as the dwarves became obsessed with dark magic.\n\nSoon, when the demonic forces came from below, remaining dwarves had to utilize their mining machines as a last resort, but the twisted magic they used in creating their machinery turned on them. In the end, the Dwarf-Demon war ended with all of the mountain people killed by their own creations. Ironic.
journal.document.intros.city.title=Dwarven Metropolis
journal.document.intros.city.body=The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of all dwarven city-states. In its heyday the dwarves built wondrous machines of metal and magic that allowed their city to expand rapidly.\n\nThen, one day, the city gates were barred and nobody heard from the dwarves again. The few who escaped the city as it closed told stories of a mad warlock who stole the throne, and the terrible magic he had learned to harness.\n\nSoon, you came out of the dungeon with the Amulet in your hands. Other heroes descended into the dungeon to clear it... out of thirteen heroes only one came back alive. He claimed the King of Dwarves was once again there, seemingly unharmed, gathering a huge army of undead to attack the city above...
journal.document.intros.halls.title=Demon Halls
journal.document.intros.halls.body=These deep halls of the Dwarven Metropolis have been twisted by dark magic. In the past these regions played host to the Dwarf King's court of elite warlocks, but now they seem to have been taken over by something even more sinister...\n\nAll sorts of horrific demonic creatures inhabit these halls, being led by some terrible dark power. If the King of Dwarves wasn't the source of the spreading corruption, whatever is down here must be.\n\nTread carefully, very few adventurers have ever descended this far...
journal.document.rk_log.title=Diary of his Almightiness
journal.document.rk_log.new_position.title=Strange things
journal.document.rk_log.new_position.body=Since eruption, d.2\n\nYesterday was the worst day ever.\n\nWoke up because of some loud screams from below, where the human criminals are kept. Like I would behave in every strange situation, I sent some of my guards to investigate. Of six guard sent, only one came, or should I say, crawled back... with ...\n\n*the rest of the page is torn out* 
journal.document.rk_log.dangerous.title=Where are my peasants?
journal.document.rk_log.dangerous.body=Since eruption, d.7\n\nDon't really get what is going on. Where are all of my peasants? Rats venture out to the outskirts of the kingdom, and never come back! Are they scared by the last week incident? I have ordered to put guards everywhere, but have heard no reports.\n\nIt seems that I have to investigate it myself, something strange is going on.
journal.document.rk_log.crabs.title=The source. Eruption
journal.document.rk_log.crabs.body=Since eruption, d.9\n\nSeems to me that everything is much more serious. I thought that all this nonsense was due to some crazy bandits gone loose, or a dwarf bot venturing to the surface, but... well what I saw was just insane. Thousands, THOUSANDS of gnolls and thugs were running around killing my rats, these are like, sewers, there is nothing here, why the hell are there that many???\n\nThe most wise decision now would be to just seal the lower levels, just lock this all away. We can't fight there.
journal.document.rk_log.guild.title=An anomaly
journal.document.rk_log.guild.body=Since eruption, d.14\n\nI don't know what it is. We lost a lot of warriors in those two weeks. Black ooze is corrupting the water below, we don't have access to the deeper kingdom half anymore. I have ordered all of my rats to come to the surface levels of the dungeon.\n\n "We are strong, when we are together!" - says Chief. Hope he is right.
journal.document.rk_log.lost.title=A new status quo
journal.document.rk_log.lost.body=Since eruption, d.16\n\nTalked with Chief today. We have successfully blocked the upper entrances and no monsters should come here, but we do have some problems. First, half of our kingdom is gone, filled with black slugs and white-eyed psychopaths. Second, we are experiencing a lack of resources, and the food is scarce. We have no power to fight all of those corrupted things, nor we can't go out to the surface. This... seems a bit hard to handle.\n\nI'll send the plan to Chief. No one comes into my kingdom, no one comes out. We cannot let more rats perish. Let us hope for the best, dear diary.
journal.document.rk_log.not_worth.title=To my King. Cheddar, head chief of south patrol.
journal.document.rk_log.not_worth.body=\nReport 145\nSir, one of our groups has actually been on the surface today, and guess, there is finally hope: rumors of monsters in the dungeon made a hero come here. We have to offer them any assistance we can, otherwise we can lose the rest of our kingdom.\n\nReport 147\nSir, this hero has already destroyed the gnolls below, we might have an actual chance. It is not a threat.
journal.document.prisoner.title=Notes of a fallen warrior
journal.document.prisoner.journal.title=Captured.
journal.document.prisoner.journal.body=Day 1.\n\nToday is the worst day. A sorrowful day for our clan. Most shinobi, ironically, got killed, some captured. I was fighting their knights, and then... was brought here, along with my clan members.\n\nThis is not simply a jail, it is a nightmare. The only food given to us is rotten rice, the only water source are pipes of the sewer system above... We need a plan, and we need it urgently.
journal.document.prisoner.recruits.title=The deal.
journal.document.prisoner.recruits.body=Day 39.\n\nIt might have been a mistake, but it was the only option. Hunger was too much, and I made a deal with the prison warden: I, and survived clan members, get provided with decent food rations instead of leftovers, but I defend the prison as a guard. The only condition is for me not to leave my floor, preventing anything from going from above and below. We are too weak to escape, so... what else can be done?
journal.document.prisoner.mines.title=Screams.
journal.document.prisoner.mines.body=Day 152\n\nLast week was just... horrifying. On the first day, no guards came to check in, the second day filled the whole prison with screams from both upper and lower chambers. The rest five days would have been completely silent if not the squeaks of the cavern bats...I hope everything will be back to normal soon.
journal.document.prisoner.rotberry.title=...
journal.document.prisoner.rotberry.body=The writing is indecipherable.

All of this, the voices of long gone clan members, the screams, the whispers trying to convince me to succumb, the hunger...

journal.document.courtman.title=The scholar's writings
journal.document.courtman.discovery.title=110, year 390
journal.document.courtman.discovery.body=Well, magic always leaves a trail, as they say. I am on a path to a breakthrough!\n\nSince last year, I have been hearing voices, telling me what to do to uncover the secrets universe keeps holding away from me, and FINALLY, a physical manifestation! The court will be pleased... soon there will be no need to hide such discoveries!
journal.document.courtman.collapse.title=129, year 390
journal.document.courtman.collapse.body=I am writing this as everything above me crumbles to dust, everything we built is being destroyed. Some maniac entered the court and... killed all of its members...I know, I know they can still move, speak and behave similarly, but that is such an obvious lie. He made them fall unconscious, and then rise, as nothing bad happened. The only difference is that they obey his command.\n\nThe problem is, I don't really know how many people were converted, how much influence he has on our people. Well, luckily for me, I have something up my sleeve to counter such a thing.\n\nI hope it is worth it.
journal.document.courtman.bomb.title=130, year 390
journal.document.courtman.bomb.body=The gate to that horrible realm was supposed to be only a tiny hole, only for us to drain energy from it and unveil eldritch secrets... But I destabilized it. Planted a bomb under his very throne.\n\nNow, the only thing I can and should do is to escape. In theory, if there is a source of great power at his disposal, any magic from it would open the unstable portal and summon something beyond my comprehension. Not really sure what will happen after that, but from what I saw the "King" is almost omnipotent, and even this might not be enough to defeat him.\n\nNow I just need to run, as far as I can.
journal.document.courtman.aftermath.title=115, year 392
journal.document.courtman.aftermath.body=More than a year has passed after that incident. The incident where a warlock enslaved the entire kingdom, and I... made that mistake. It seems to me that the king had lost, but something far more sinister was created.\n\nYesterday a rumor came to me that cavern dwarves are in war, with their Metropolis being fully overrun by demons and undead...yeah, there is a lot to take there. Might just be a rumor, but... what if this is true? That portal, from what I researched, leads to the world of... no, no, It couldn't be. It was only supposed to weaken him.
journal.document.courtman.heroes.title=287, year 393
journal.document.courtman.heroes.body=Well, the dungeon buisness is booming! The Council has managed to fight the demonic forces below, by sending in heroes! Though heroes never come back from the dungeon, not a single monster has escaped to the surface! I don't really care what happened, but the war is long over, we are safe, and I can finally rest...
journal.document.courtman.again.title=94, year 394
journal.document.courtman.again.body=This is horrible, something even worse is going on. In one day, a hero came up with an Amulet of sorts, claiming the underground is cleared, several earthquakes happened and several packs of insane prisoners ran away from the damned dungeon...\n\nWas that even a hero? Why are monsters coming out of the sewers in such numbers? I think I will have to talk to Him today, this is anything but normal.
journal.document.halls_king.title=The King's diary, last pages
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.title=There is no point, there is no end to them.
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.body=Every single day, I send a ton of warlocks there, but it seems to me that the more of them are sacrificed, the more undead fleshlings come from the damned halls. Time for the heavy artillery, they don't know that flesh and blood isn't only thing at my disposal! Sending in the machines!\n\n- The King of dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.amulet.title=I will do it MYSELF
journal.document.halls_king.amulet.body=I can't really see any progress with it, I thought I can stop an ancient god by sending him mortal soldiers, the idea was a failure from the start! What is more, I can feel it feeding, feeding on my source of power, the Amulet, devouring my soldiers, and with each day its grasp on my domain becomes stronger. What is worse, my control of the Amulet's magic seems to... weaken, my soldiers are not mine anymore, each time they attempt to travel deeper some of the group start killing their own kind!\n\nTHIS IS IT! I WILL COME DOWN, TO THIS CURSED BASEMENT OF THIS CURSED CITY, TAKE THE AMULET, AND GET RID OF THIS PEST.\n\n- The King of the Dwarven Metropolis
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.title=Success. But at what cost?
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.body=I did it. Well, I did something. Luckily for me, I didn't lose all power yet, with what was left I trapped this being, sealed it, with what power the Amulet had. The dwarves are back in my control, but something... feels off. Like its avatar is still here, but I don't see anything to fight against.\n\nBetter to lock this thing, or what is left after it, away. It is sealed, everything is fine, I am the King, and I will remain one. And I still have my powers, even if it tries to do something, next time I will be ruthless.\n\n- The King of dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.nightmare.title=Misery
journal.document.halls_king.nightmare.body=This nightmare, I sensed it. That "Something off" feeling I experienced back when I slayed the Foul Beast.\n\nCame to investigate, and... something is coming. Far stronger than I imagined. Thick black smoke is oozing from below the lower city gates, any magic I tried is weak against it. There seems to be only one way: barricade the gates. And wait. If that is Yog again, I know one thing - sending it forces is fueling it. Each dwarf consumed by demonic flames is one more soldier in his army, so NOT TODAY, EYEBALL! NOT IN ETERNITY!\n\n- The King of dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.thing.title=A hero
journal.document.halls_king.thing.body=A problem is here. And a huge one it seems: my minions reported a hero destroying the Dwarven Machine 300, the Upper gate guardian of my domain. Heroes, what are they? I thought after a million deaths by sewer animals no one even dares to come this deep.\n\nI thought about it, what will happen if they manage to pass me? Unlock these gates and what is worse... free the Demon? The End of the World. Dwarves, gnolls, goblins, humans above, the entire continent, maybe all the living beings in this universe will perish.\n\nI have to prepare.\n\n- The IMMORTAL King
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.title=Am I... Really... Immortal?
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.body=I woke up. What I remember, is the hero, somehow... defeating, me. And somehow, I am back here, unharmed. I felt something was wrong: once again, the gates to the lower halls are opened, and none of my court are present.\n\nAnd then I heard it...\n\nThe CALL...\n\nI don't think I can resist it, the voices are commanding, demonic in nature. It happened. I lost, the hero doomed his own world.\n\nI am feeling drowsy. The will, it is fading. This is only a moment of clarity it seems, but why? If I did really die, how did it brought me back? Why would it let me see the world once again? Perhaps, just to torture what is left of my soul. For who finds it, please, I beg, slay him. The Amulet, It needs to be put back, and once it is weakened, strike. Bring armies, throw them into It, NO MATTER HOW MANY WILL DIE, BUT IT IS WOR...\n\n[Words after are indecipherable, some partially covered in black oozy substance.
