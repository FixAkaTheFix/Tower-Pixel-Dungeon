scenes.levelselectscene.arena1name=_Sewer entrance_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1desc=An entrance of the sewers, the place where every dungeoneer's journey begins. To enter, you'll need to get rid of all the rodents first, shouldn't be an issue
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (many), snakes(few), gnolls (some), crabs(few)\n_Boss_: Fetid rat 
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1advise=\nIn some battles even the most powerful heroes can't win alone...For such cases, you have towers!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena2name=_Deeper sewers_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2desc=Venturing deeper into the sewers, you found out that you are not quite welcome here. You entered the domain of the Rat king, a rodent powerful enough to enslave all rats around. And those rats definitely don't like you.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (a ton), snakes(some), gnolls (some), crabs(many), slimes(some), bandits(few)\n_Minibosses_: Fetid rat, Chief rat\n#Boss#: Rat king
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2advise=\nSometimes you should go away from your base to scavenge for loot. The findings may surprise you.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena3name=_Gnoll village_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3desc=Seems that humans aren't the only sentient creatures around: on your adventure you stumbled onto a gnoll village. Looking at your surroundings, you realize two things: first - those gnolls are really well-equipped for such low depths, second - they absolutely hate sudden guests.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (few), snakes(few), gnolls (a ton), crabs(some)\n_Guards_: Crossbow turrets (some)\n_Minibosses_: Gnoll trickster, Gnoll shaman, Gnoll brute\n`Special`: Long wave cooldown
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3advise=\nIf your base lacks resources, enemy base is always there.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena4name=_Crab lake_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4desc=You have already grown tired of going towards, the labyrinth-like sewers felt infinitely large. What a surprise it was when you found a small cave, with a lot of foliage and a small lake in its center. You thought that such a peaceful place would be a great spot to set a camp in, but after you saw a giant claw in the grass, you started to prepare the defenses.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), slimes(few), crabs(many)\n_Guards_: lashers (many), piranhas (some)\n_Minibosses_: Hermit Crab, Great crab, MagiCrabs \n#Boss#: The Goo.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4advise=Magic totally ignores physical defense

scenes.levelselectscene.arena5name=_Caustic depths_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5desc=Now you know where did this black slime came from: a dark, destroyed, vile hallway is right in front of you. Strange sounds emit from its end, and you know for sure, that you have to kill what's in there to proceed...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5knowledge=_Number of waves_: _25_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), crabs(few), slimes (many), caustic slimes (many)\n_Minibosses_: Goo\n#Boss#: The Ooze.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5advise=\nCannons can deal area damage and are much more effective than other towers if shooting at a group.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena6name=_The Prison_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most people left, and ones who stayed either died or gone insane. Such a place is very dangerous to be in, and noises in the distance confirm it.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), slimes(few), bandits(many), guards(many),gnolls(many), necromancers(some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, gnoll trickster\n`Special`: Longer wave cooldowns, prison warden sells loot keys
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6advise=\nSpend all the money you have, that is how you keep up!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena7name=_Mage meeting_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7desc=Since magic is forbidden in most cities on surface, wizards, necromancers, witches and druids usually practice their spells underground. Since the darkness consumed this prison, most mages' minds got corrupted as well, making them prevent you from coming further down
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  rats(few), snakes(few), caustic slimes(few), gnoll shamans(many), guards(some), necromancers(some), magicrabs (some), ghouls (few)\n_Minibosses_: ghoul, elementals\n`Special`: Rot lashers periodically invade your base
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7advise=\nSometimes a level cannot be completed for the first time. Learn its map, threats and loot, then try again.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena8name=_Prison Graveyard_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8desc=In a place once quiet, now is filled with growls and screams of once buried here. From some guards on the surface you know, that a necromancer of tremendous power has found a hideaway here, and left an army of resurrected warriors to protect himself. And it's quite obvious, that those undead soldiers won't let you pass easily...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (some), hex shamans (some), skeletons (a ton), wraiths (many), necromancers(some), flies (few), gravestones(few)\n#Boss#: Remac, the undead lord.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8advise=\nArea effect potions like toxic, paralytic gas and flame can be extremely useful. Also throwing a levitation potion creates a disorientating cloud.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena9name=_Undead vs Bandits
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9desc=After defeating Remac, you partially gained his powers: now you can summon undead at will by building gravestones. You really want to test such powers, and you already see a pack of bandits coming your way.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_: gnolls (some), bandits(many), thieves(some)\n_Minibosses_:  gnoll tricksters.\n`Special`: you can defend with graves and walls only.\n
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9advise=Gravestones can be used to defeat single enemies and slow down enemy forces for your turrets to shoot them.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena10name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most people left, and ones who stayed either died or gone insane. Such a place is very dangerous to be in, and noises in the distance confirm it.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bandits(some), guards(some), DM100 (some), bats (some), Brutes (some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, armored guards, gnoll tricksters\n#Boss#: Tengu
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10advise=\nSometimes a tower should be salvaged, especially when it is almost broken or placed badly.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena11name=_Upper caves_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11desc= The safest, and the broadest part of the general cave system, where dwarves used to mine gold and gems. As of now, there aren't any living beings left, apart from rats, bats and goblins, but even those are substantially more aggressive than usual.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  Rats(some), gnolls(some), bats(some), spiders(some), goblins(some), sometimes other wildlife\n`Special`: Cave's ceiling is unstable
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena12name=_Underground lakes_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12desc=On your way you have found an enourmous cave, almost flooded with water. These grounds will be quite hard to travel through, but, fortunately or sadly, this is the shortest of paths, and you cannot delay sealing the nightmarish evil below and saving the world.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_:  piranhas (some), bats(many), crabs(a TON), fly swarms(some)
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena13name=`SPECIAL: Golden rush`
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13desc=There are several great threats ahead and you have thought it would be a great idea to gather some resources first. Luckily, there is a gold-rich shaft nearby. This cave is owned by a nearby goblin community so you better do this quick and stealthy.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13knowledge=_Enemies_: goblins(few)\n`Special`: No Amulet, goblin patrols are present. The more those goblin patrols are engaged in a fight and the more time passes, the faster the goblins will notice you being present and the sooner _huge_ guard reinforcements will arrive. You can win either by _mining a total of 5000 gold _(spending it does not decrease the counter) or _repel the attack of goblin reinforcements_, the wave countdown shows how soon will the reinforcement arrive.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena14name=_Goblin cave camp_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14desc="There is no place in the entire universe where a goblin hasn't been" - says the dungeoneering encyclopedia, and is probably right, as you have stumbled on a goblin outpost in caves that deep. A guard has already noticed your presence, and a horde of these green creatures is coming your way...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  different goblins(a ton), goblin giants (some), goblin shamans(some)\n#Boss:# Troll horde
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena15name=_Warehouses_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15desc=After the great civilization of dwarves fell, all their equipment, shafts and technology was pretty much abandoned down in the dungeon. The results of it are worse than you could possibly expect: all the machinery is broken, toxic waste has leaked into the underground waters and all the mining bots went rogue, killing any living creature in their path. Possibly, stuff left in there can help you fend off the incoming attacks.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bats(some), spiders(some), explosion bots(many), DM100 (many), DM200 (many), golems (some), mutants (many), DWM assemble kit parts \n_Minibosses_: DM300, DWM (Dwarven WarMachine)\n`Special`: Acidic water, no shops, a lot of useful equipment present nearby.
