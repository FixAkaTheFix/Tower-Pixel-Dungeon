scenes.supporterscene.intro=What should I say here...
scenes.supporterscene.patreon_msg=This game won't ever have any direct support features, mostly because the project is quite small and most of the code is not mine. So, what can you actually do to aid me in my PD-modding adventure?\n\n_Spread the word about this project_ - if you have any friends who like pixel dungeon, its mods or tower defense games, you can show this game to them!\n\n_Bugtesting_ - as this is a 0.1.0 version, there simply must be bugs there. If you found one, report it to me via `Discord` (`fixakathefix` - you can find me in PD discord server) or #Reddit# (u/#FixAkaTheFix#)\n\nGreat thanks to _Evan_ for making ShPD, using it's engine I am able to improve and polish my programming skills, mostly by making this game. Also thanks for all the people who supported me thus far, including my friends, the PD discord community and my parents.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena0knowledge=_Number of waves_: _many_\n_Enemies_: rats, in the numbers of the wave number.\n\nThere you can learn what towers are, how to buy them and set them up, the amulet, and play around with controls for a bit, if you wish so.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena0advise

scenes.levelselectscene.arena1name=_Sewer entrance_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1desc=An entrance of the sewers, the place where every dungeoneer's journey begins. To enter, you'll need to get rid of all the rodents first, shouldn't be an issue
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (many), snakes(few), gnolls (some), crabs(few)\n_Boss_: Fetid rat 
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1advise=\nIn some battles even the most powerful heroes can't win alone...For such cases, you have towers!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena2name=_Deeper sewers_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2desc=Venturing deeper into the sewers, you found out that you are not quite welcome here. You entered the domain of the Rat king, a rodent powerful enough to enslave all rats around. And those rats definitely don't like you.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (a ton), snakes(some), gnolls (some), crabs(many), slimes(some), bandits(few)\n_Minibosses_: Fetid rat, Chief rat\n#Boss#: Rat king
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2advise=\nSometimes you should go away from your base to scavenge for loot. The findings may surprise you.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena3name=_Gnoll village_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3desc=Seems that humans aren't the only sentient creatures around: on your adventure you stumbled onto a gnoll village. Looking at your surroundings, you realize two things: first - those gnolls are really well-equipped for such low depths, second - they absolutely hate sudden guests.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (few), snakes(few), gnolls (a ton), crabs(some)\n_Guards_: Crossbow turrets (some)\n_Minibosses_: Gnoll trickster, Gnoll shaman, Gnoll brute\n`Special`: Long wave cooldown
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3advise=\nIf your base lacks resources, enemy base is always there.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena4name=_Crab lake_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4desc=You have already grown tired of going towards, the labyrinth-like sewers felt infinitely large. What a surprise it was when you found a small cave, with a lot of foliage and a small lake in its center. You thought that such a peaceful place would be a great spot to set a camp in, but after you saw a giant claw in the grass, you started to prepare the defenses.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), slimes(few), crabs(many)\n_Guards_: lashers (many), piranhas (some)\n_Minibosses_: Hermit Crab, Great crab, MagiCrabs \n#Boss#: The Goo.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4advise=Magic totally ignores physical defense

scenes.levelselectscene.arena5name=_Caustic depths_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5desc=Now you know where did this black slime came from: a dark, destroyed, vile hallway is right in front of you. Strange sounds emit from its end, and you know for sure, that you have to kill what's in there to proceed...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5knowledge=_Number of waves_: _25_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), crabs(few), slimes (many), caustic slimes (many)\n_Minibosses_: Goo\n#Boss#: The Ooze.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5advise=\nCannons can deal area damage and are much more effective than other towers if shooting at a group.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena6name=_The Prison_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most people left, and ones who stayed either died or gone insane. Such a place is very dangerous to be in, and noises in the distance confirm it.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), slimes(few), bandits(many), guards(many),gnolls(many), necromancers(some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, gnoll trickster\n`Special`: Longer wave cooldowns, prison warden sells loot keys
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6advise=\nSpend all the money you have, that is how you keep up!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena7name=_Mage meeting_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7desc=Since magic is forbidden in most cities on surface, wizards, necromancers, witches and druids usually practice their spells underground. Since the darkness consumed this prison, most mages' minds got corrupted as well, making them prevent you from coming further down
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  rats(few), snakes(few), caustic slimes(few), gnoll shamans(many), guards(some), necromancers(some), magicrabs (some), ghouls (few)\n_Minibosses_: ghoul, elementals\n`Special`: Rot lashers periodically invade your base
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7advise=\nSometimes a level cannot be completed for the first time. Learn its map, threats and loot, then try again.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena8name=_Prison Graveyard_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8desc=In a place once quiet, now is filled with growls and screams of once buried here. From some guards on the surface you know, that a necromancer of tremendous power has found a hideaway here, and left an army of resurrected warriors to protect himself. And it's quite obvious, that those undead soldiers won't let you pass easily...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (some), hex shamans (some), skeletons (a ton), wraiths (many), necromancers(some), flies (few), gravestones(few)\n#Boss#: Remac, the undead lord.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8advise=\nArea effect potions like toxic, paralytic gas and flame can be extremely useful. Also throwing a levitation potion creates a disorientating cloud.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena9name=_Undead vs Bandits
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9desc=After defeating Remac, you partially gained his powers: now you can summon undead at will by building gravestones. You really want to test such powers, and you already see a pack of bandits coming your way.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_: gnolls (some), bandits(many), thieves(some)\n_Minibosses_:  gnoll tricksters.\n`Special`: you can defend with graves and walls only.\n
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9advise=Gravestones can be used to defeat single enemies and slow down enemy forces for your turrets to shoot them.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena10name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most people left, and ones who stayed either died or gone insane. Such a place is very dangerous to be in, and noises in the distance confirm it.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bandits(some), guards(some), DM100 (some), bats (some), Brutes (some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, armored guards, gnoll tricksters\n#Boss#: Tengu
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10advise=\nSometimes a tower should be salvaged, especially when it is almost broken or placed badly.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena11name=_Upper caves_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11desc= The safest, and the broadest part of the general cave system, where dwarves used to mine gold and gems. As of now, there aren't any living beings left, apart from rats, bats and goblins, but even those are substantially more aggressive than usual.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  Rats(some), gnolls(some), bats(some), spiders(some), goblins(some), sometimes other wildlife\n`Special`: The afterwave gold is dropped from automatic miners, which you must defend and manually collect gold from.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena12name=_Underground lakes_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12desc=On your way you have found an enourmous cave, almost flooded with water. These grounds will be quite hard to travel through, but, fortunately or sadly, this is the shortest of paths, and you cannot delay sealing the nightmarish evil below and saving the world.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_:  piranhas (some), bats(many), crabs(a TON), fly swarms(some)
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena13name=_The temple_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13desc=It is not surprising that a monster-filled dungeon would lead you to some kind of ancient ruins. Because of it being filled with traps there is less monsters than around. Next time you look around you see several groups of cavern wildlife and gnoll scouts, and decide to hide in one of the temples. Hopefully, it's defenses are still intact.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13knowledge=_Enemies_:  gnolls (many), swarms (some), bats (some), goblins(few), spiders (some), ancient spirits (none)
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena14name=_Goblin cave camp_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14desc="There is no place in the entire universe where a goblin hasn't been" - says the dungeoneering encyclopedia, and is probably right, as you have stumbled on a goblin outpost in caves that deep. A guard has already noticed your presence, and a horde of these green creatures is coming your way...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  different goblins(a ton), goblin giants (some), goblin shamans(some)\n#Boss:# Troll horde
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena15name=_Warehouses_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15desc=After the great civilization of dwarves fell, all their equipment, shafts and technology was pretty much abandoned down in the dungeon. The results of it are worse than you could possibly expect: all the machinery is broken, toxic waste has leaked into the underground waters and all the mining bots went rogue, killing any living creature in their path. Possibly, stuff left in there can help you fend off the incoming attacks.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bats(some), spiders(some), explosion bots(many), DM100 (many), DM200 (many), golems (some), mutants (many), DWM assemble kit parts \n_Minibosses_: DM300, DWM (Dwarven WarMachine)\n`Special`: Acidic water, no shops, a lot of useful equipment present nearby.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena16name=_The City_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena16desc=What was a blooming metropolis in the past is standing before you. Robbed houses, only some of which don't have their walls crushed, destroyed robots, which will never be maintained anymore, and undead monks and warlocks, with their minds possessed...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena16knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _20_\n\n_Enemies_:  snakes(few), slimes(few), bandits(some), guards(some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, armored guards

scenes.levelselectscene.arena17name=#A Horrible Dream#
scenes.levelselectscene.arena17desc=You wake up, and realize you are not in the dwarven house anymore... An island, made of corpses and bone dust, echoing screams, a phantasmagoria of monster images around. The only thing you hear is a menacing whisper...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena17knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: #YOU. WILL. DIE.#\n\n_Enemies_: #YOU. WILL. SUFFER.#

scenes.levelselectscene.arena18name=_Storm the gates!_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena18desc=After that dream you wake up completely restless, but you somehow know where the Dwarf King's castle and, supposedly, the corruption source are located. You decided to go directly to it, and a giant dwarven drill you found will be very useful in such a task.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena18knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _until you get to the gates_\n\n_Enemies_: wraiths (some), dwarven warlocks (some), dwarven monks (some), golems (some), guard towers (some)\n\n`Special`: You are riding a giant drill. All towers on it will move as the drill moves.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena19name=_The treasury_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena19desc=Any monarch of such power as the king of all dwarves must have their own treasury, where they keep all the magical valuables they found. Before you are fighting the DK himself, preparing and gathering up some gold and battle artifacts would be a great idea. But obviously, no king leaves his treasures unguarded.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena19knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _13_\n\n_Enemies_:  dwarven warlocks (some), dwarven monks (some), Golems (few), ghouls (many)\n\nNote: find special artifacts in chests, the keys are located around the map.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena20name=_The False King's fall_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena20desc=You approach the giant throne room, and in it's center, The King is sitting. Once the protector of the amulet, next a mass murderer, and now simply a puppet with a crown. The only way through - is through him. Him, and his undead legion.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena20knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _25_\n\n_Enemies_:  dwarven warlocks (a lot), dwarven monks (a lot), Golems (many), ghouls (many), Skeletons (a LEGION), armored skeletons(a lot)\n\n#Boss#: "Dwarf King".\n\n_Note_: this battle is very hard and may require many attempts. The King _adapts_ to your strategy on the go.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena21name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena21desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most people left, and ones who stayed either died or gone insane. Such a place is very dangerous to be in, and noises in the distance confirm it.
