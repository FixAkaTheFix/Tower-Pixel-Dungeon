You can also decide to just hold onto the amulet, stay a mere mortal a little longer, and perhaps leave the dungeon the old fashioned way...

scenes.supporterscene.intro=What should I say here...
scenes.supporterscene.patreon_msg=This game won't ever have any direct support features, mostly because the project is quite small and most of the code is not mine. So, what can you actually do to aid me in my PD-modding adventure?\n\n_Spread the word about this project_ - if you have any friends who like pixel dungeon, its mods or tower defense games, you can show this game to them!\n\n_Bugtesting_ - as this is far from a release version, there are certainly bugs around. If you find one, report it to me via `Discord` (`@fixakathefix` - you can find me in the PD discord server) or #Reddit# (u/#FixAkaTheFix#)\n\nGreat thanks to _Evan_ for making ShPD, using it as a base I am able to improve and polish my programming skills, mostly by making this game. Also thanks to all the people who supported me thus far, including my friends, the PD discord community and my parents.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena0name=_Tutorial and playground_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena0desc=A short tutorial for new players. 
scenes.levelselectscene.arena0knowledge=_Number of waves_: _many_\n_Enemies_: rats, count matching the wave number.\n\nHere you can learn what towers are, how to buy them and set them up, how the amulet works and play around with controls for a bit if you wish to.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena0advise

scenes.levelselectscene.arena1name=_Sewers entrance_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1desc=An entrance of the sewers, the place where every dungeoneer's journey begins. To enter, you'll need to get rid of all the rodents first, shouldn't be an issue.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (many), snakes (few), gnolls (some), crabs (few)\n_Boss_: Fetid rat 
scenes.levelselectscene.arena1advise=\nSome battles can't be won alone even by the strongest hero...For such cases, you have towers!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena2name=_Deeper sewers_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2desc=Venturing deeper into the sewers, you find out that you are not quite welcome here. You entered the domain of the Rat king, a rodent powerful enough to enslave all rats around. And the rats aren't enjoying your presence.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (a ton), snakes (some), gnolls (some), crabs (many), slimes (some), bandits (few)\n_Minibosses_: Fetid rat, Chief rat\n#Boss#: Rat king
scenes.levelselectscene.arena2advise=\nSometimes it's good to venture further from your base to scavenge for loot. What you find may surprise you.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena3name=_Gnoll village_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3desc=Seems that humans aren't the only sentient creatures around: on your adventure you stumbled onto a gnoll village. Looking at your surroundings, you realize two things: first - those gnolls are really well-equipped for these depths, second - they absolutely hate sudden guests.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_: rats (few), snakes (few), gnolls (a ton), crabs (some)\n_Guards_: Crossbow turrets (some)\n_Minibosses_: Gnoll trickster, Gnoll shaman, Gnoll brute\n`Special`: Long wave cooldown.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena3advise=\nIf your base lacks resources, why not borrow some from the enemy's?

scenes.levelselectscene.arena4name=_Crab lake_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4desc=You have already grown tired of moving forward, the labyrinthine sewers feeling unfathomably large. What a surprise it was to find a little cave with a lot of foliage and a small lake in its center. You naively believed you discovered a great spot to camp at, but once you spotted a giant claw in the grass, it was time to prepare the defenses.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  snakes (few), slimes (few), crabs (many)\n_Guards_: lashers (many), piranhas (some)\n_Minibosses_: Hermit Crab, Great crab, MagiCrabs \n#Boss#: The Goo
scenes.levelselectscene.arena4advise=Magic completely ignores physical defense.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena5name=_Caustic depths_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5desc=Now you know where that black slime came from: a dark, decrepit, vile hallway extends in front of you. Strange sounds reach you from its end, and you know for sure that you'll have to kill what's in there to proceed...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5knowledge=_Number of waves_: _25_\n_Enemies_:  snakes (few), crabs (few), slimes (many), caustic slimes (many)\n_Minibosses_: Goo\n#Boss#: The Ooze.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena5advise=\nCannons can deal area damage and are much more effective than other towers when targeting a group.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena6name=_The Prison_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most of them left, and those who stayed have either died or gone insane. This place is very dangerous to be in, and the distant noises confirm that.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  snakes (few), slimes (few), bandits (many), guards (many), gnolls (many), necromancers (some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, gnoll trickster\n`Special`: Longer wave cooldowns, prison warden sells loot keys.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena6advise=\nSpend all the money you have, that is how you keep up!

scenes.levelselectscene.arena7name=_Mage meeting_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7desc=Since magic is forbidden in most cities on the surface, wizards, necromancers, witches and druids usually practice their spells underground. Once the darkness consumed this prison, most mages' minds got corrupted as well, driving them to stop you from descending further.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  rats (few), snakes (few), caustic slimes (few), gnoll shamans (many), guards (some), necromancers (some), magicrabs (some), ghouls (few)\n_Minibosses_: ghoul, elementals\n`Special`: Rot lashers periodically invade your base.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena7advise=\nSometimes a level cannot be completed on the first attempt. Learn its map, threats and loot, then try again.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena8name=_Prison Graveyard_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8desc=A once quiet place is now quaking with the growls and screams of those buried here. From some guards on the surface you know that a necromancer of tremendous power has found a hideaway here, and left an army of resurrected warriors to protect himself. And it's quite obvious that those undead soldiers won't simply let you pass...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_: rats (some), hex shamans (some), skeletons (a ton), wraiths (many), necromancers (some), flies (few), gravestones (few)\n#Boss#: Remac, the undead lord.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena8advise=\nArea effect potions like toxic and paralytic gases and flame can be extremely useful. Also, shattering a levitation potion creates a disorienting cloud.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena9name=_Undead vs Bandits_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9desc=After defeating Remac you gained some of his powers: now you can summon undead at will by building gravestones. You really want to put your new abilities to a test, and you already see a pack of bandits coming your way.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_: gnolls (some), bandits (many), thieves (some)\n_Minibosses_:  gnoll tricksters\n`Special`: You can defend with graves and walls only.\n
scenes.levelselectscene.arena9advise=Gravestones can be used to defeat single enemies and slow down enemy forces for your turrets to shoot them.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena10name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most of them left, and those who stayed have either died or gone insane. This place is very dangerous to be in, and the distant noises confirm that.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bandits (some), guards (some), DM100 (some), bats (some), Brutes (some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, armored guards, gnoll tricksters\n#Boss#: Tengu
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10advise=\nSometimes a tower should be salvaged, especially when it is almost broken or poorly placed.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena11name=_Upper caves_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11desc= The safest and broadest part of the general cave system, where dwarves used to mine for gold and gems. As of now, there aren't any living beings left apart from rats, bats and goblins, and those are substantially more aggressive than usual.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  Rats (some), gnolls (some), bats (some), spiders (some), goblins (some), sometimes other wildlife\n`Special`: The afterwave gold is dropped from automatic miners, which you must defend and manually collect gold from.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena11advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena12name=_Underground lakes_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12desc=On your way you have found an enormous cave, almost entirely flooded. These grounds will be quite hard to navigate, but for better or worse, this is the shortest path, and you cannot delay sealing the nightmarish evil below and saving the world.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12knowledge=_Number of waves_: _10_\n_Enemies_:  piranhas (some), bats (many), crabs (a TON), fly swarms (some)
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena13name=_The temple_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13desc=It is not surprising that a monster-filled dungeon would lead you to some kind of ancient ruins. Owing to the amount of traps scattered around, there are unusually few monsters here. At a glance you spot several groups of cavern wildlife and gnoll scouts and decide to hide in one of the temples. Hopefully its defenses are still intact.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13knowledge=_Enemies_:  gnolls (many), swarms (some), bats (some), goblins (few), spiders (some), ancient spirits (none)
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena14name=_Goblin cave camp_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14desc="There is no place in the entire universe where a goblin hasn't been" - says the dungeoneering encyclopedia, and it's probably right, looking at this goblin outpost in caves this deep. A guard has already noticed your presence, and a horde of these green creatures is coming your way...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14knowledge=_Number of waves_: _15_\n_Enemies_:  different goblins (a ton), goblin giants (some), goblin shamans (some)\n#Boss:# Troll horde
scenes.levelselectscene.arena14advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena15name=_Warehouses_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15desc=After the great civilization of dwarves fell, all their equipment, shafts and technology were pretty much abandoned down in the dungeon. And it all aged worse than you'd expect: all the machinery is broken, toxic waste has leaked into the underground waters and all the mining bots went rogue, killing any living creature in their path. Perhaps the leftover stuff can help you fend off the incoming attacks.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bats (some), spiders (some), explosion bots (many), DM100 (many), DM200 (many), golems (some), mutants (many), DWM assemble kit parts \n_Minibosses_: DM300, DWM (Dwarven WarMachine)\n`Special`: Acidic water, no shops, a lot of useful equipment present nearby.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15advise=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena16name=_The City_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena16desc=What was a blooming metropolis in the past stands before you. Pillaged houses, few of them with their walls intact, destroyed robots with nobody to maintain them and undead monks and warlocks, with their minds possessed...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena16knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _20_\n\n_Enemies_:  snakes (few), slimes (few), bandits (some), guards (some)\n_Minibosses_: thieves, armored guards

scenes.levelselectscene.arena17name=#A Horrible Dream#
scenes.levelselectscene.arena17desc=You wake up, and realize you are not in the dwarven house anymore... but on an island made of corpses and bone dust permeated by echoing screams, with a phantasmagoria of monster images around. All you hear is a menacing whisper...
scenes.levelselectscene.arena17knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: #YOU. WILL. DIE.#\n\n_Enemies_: #YOU. WILL. SUFFER.#

scenes.levelselectscene.arena18name=_Storm the gates!_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena18desc=After that dream you wake up completely restless, somehow aware of the location of the Dwarf King's castle where the corruption source supposedly lies. You decide to cut directly to it, and the giant dwarven drill you found will be very useful for such a task.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena18knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _until you get to the gates_\n\n_Enemies_: wraiths (some), dwarven warlocks (some), dwarven monks (some), golems (some), guard towers (some)\n\n`Special`: You are riding a giant drill. All towers on it will move as the drill moves.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena19name=_The treasury_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena19desc=Any monarch of a power befitting the king of all dwarves must have their own treasury, where they keep all the magical valuables they found. Before you fight the DK himself, preparing and stocking up some gold and battle artifacts would be a great idea. But obviously, no king leaves his treasures unguarded.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena19knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _13_\n\n_Enemies_:  dwarven warlocks (some), dwarven monks (some), Golems (few), ghouls (many)\n\nNote: find special artifacts in chests, the keys are located around the map.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena20name=_The False King's fall_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena20desc=You approach the giant throne room, and at its center, The King is sitting. Once the protector of the amulet, then a mass murderer, and now simply a puppet with a crown. The only way through - is through him. Him, and his undead legion.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena20knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _25_\n\n_Enemies_:  dwarven warlocks (a lot), dwarven monks (a lot), Golems (many), ghouls (many), Skeletons (a LEGION), armored skeletons(a lot)\n\n#Boss#: "Dwarf King".\n\n_Note_: this battle is very hard and may require many attempts. The King _adapts_ to your strategy on the go.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena21name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena21desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most of them left, and those who stayed have either died or gone insane. This place is very dangerous to be in, and the distant noises confirm that.
