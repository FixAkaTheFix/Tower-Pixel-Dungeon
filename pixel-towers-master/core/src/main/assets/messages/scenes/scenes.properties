scenes.supporterscene.intro=What should I say here...
scenes.supporterscene.patreon_msg=I never thought that such a small mod, that Pixel Towers was half a year ago, would even turn into something of quality. And you, dear player, is an important part of this adventure: without any support, I would not be capable of developing the project for this long. So, what can you actually do to aid me in my PD-modding adventure?\n\n_Spread the word about this project_ - if any of your friends like pixel dungeon, its mods or tower defense games, you can show this game to them!\n\n_Bugtesting_ - as this is far from a release version, there are certainly bugs around. If you find one, report it to me via #5Discord#5 (#5@fixakathefix#5 - you can find me in the PD discord server) or #2Reddit#2 (#2u/FixAkaTheFix#2)\n\nGreat thanks to #4Evan#4 for making ShPD, using it as a base I am able to improve and polish my programming skills, mostly by making this game. Also thanks to all the people who supported me thus far, including my friends, the PD discord community and my parents.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena4desc=You have already grown tired of moving forward, the labyrinthine sewers feeling unfathomably large.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena10name=_Protected cell block_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena10desc=This prison once had a lot of both guards and outlaws inside it, but since the darkness approached from below, most of them left, and those who stayed have either died or gone insane. This place is very dangerous to be in, and the distant noises confirm that.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena12desc=These mines were built on a specific depth with the most dark gold deposits, and after all the precious metals had been taken, the dwarves went deeper, leaving these mined corridors.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena12advise=
scenes.levelselectscene.arena12prize=

scenes.levelselectscene.arena13name=_The temple_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13desc=It is not surprising that a monster-filled dungeon would lead you to some kind of ancient ruins. Owing to the amount of traps scattered around, there are unusually few monsters here. At a glance you spot several groups of cavern wildlife and gnoll scouts and decide to hide in one of the temples. Hopefully its defenses are still intact.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena13knowledge=_Enemies_:  gnolls (many), swarms (some), bats (some), goblins (few), spiders (some), ancient spirits (none)

scenes.levelselectscene.arena15name=_Warehouses_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15desc=After the great civilization of dwarves fell, all their equipment, shafts and technology were pretty much abandoned down in the dungeon. And it all aged worse than you'd expect: all the machinery is broken, toxic waste has leaked into the underground waters and all the mining bots went rogue, killing any living creature in their path. Perhaps the leftover stuff can help you fend off the incoming attacks.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena15knowledge=_Number of waves_: _20_\n_Enemies_:  bats (some), spiders (some), explosion bots (many), DM100 (many), DM200 (many), golems (some), mutants (many), DWM assemble kit parts \n_Minibosses_: DM300, DWM (Dwarven WarMachine)\n`Special`: Acidic water, no shops, a lot of useful equipment present nearby.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena18desc=After that dream you wake up completely restless, somehow aware of the location of the Dwarf King's castle where the corruption source supposedly lies. You decide to cut directly to it, and the giant dwarven drill you found will be very useful for such a task.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena19name=_The treasury_
scenes.levelselectscene.arena19desc=Any monarch of a power befitting the king of all dwarves must have their own treasury, where they keep all the magical valuables they found.

scenes.levelselectscene.arena20desc=You approach the giant throne room, and at its center, The King is sitting. Once the protector of the amulet, then a mass murderer, and now simply a puppet with a crown. The only way through - is through him. Him, and his undead legion.
scenes.levelselectscene.arena20knowledge=\n\n_Number of waves_: _25_\n_Enemies_:  dwarven warlocks (a lot), dwarven monks (a lot), Golems (many), ghouls (many), Skeletons (a LEGION), armored skeletons(a lot)\n#1Boss#1: "Dwarf King".\n\n_Note_: this battle is very hard and may require many attempts.
